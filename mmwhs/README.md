MM-WHS patch extraction
=======================
Use these scripts to extract patches from MM-WHS data.

The scripts require the MM-WHS source files, which can be downloaded from the [MM-WHS website](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/).

Edit the file to use the correct source and target folders for your system.

Run `whs_data.py` to extract patches and generate the data files.
